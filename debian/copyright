 DOSBox implementation of a combined Yamaha YMF262 and Yamaha YM3812 emulator.
 Enabling the opl3 bit will switch the emulator to stereo opl3 output instead of regular mono opl2
 Except for the table generation it's all integer math
 Can choose different types of generators, using muls and bigger tables, try different ones for slower platforms
 The generation was based on the MAME implementation but tried to have it use less memory and be faster in general
 MAME uses much bigger envelope tables and this will be the biggest cause of it sounding different at times
